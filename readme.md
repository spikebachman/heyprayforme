# heyprayfor.me

### Introduction

heyprayfor.me is an experiment intended to enrich people's connection and empathy for each other through prayer.

To avoid fear of conflict and encourage heartfelt prayer requests, users operate in anonymity — no personally identifiable information is asked for.

The platform is religion-agnostic, People who participate are free to pray in whatever way their beliefs dictate.

For those who choose to pray for a request, they are able to indicate they've done so by clicking on the heart icon under each request — no other response is provided.

The requestor can return to heyprayfor.me and browse for their request to see if it's received prayer from others.

### Shipping plan

The first release of heyprayfor.me will be a minimum viable product as described above and ship as a website.

The end goal is to ship heyprayfor.me apps for mobile platforms.

As a mobile app, certain additional features, such as new prayer requests/prayers received notifications will be possible.

Still, I never intend to complicate the app in ways that confuse it's purpose. heyprayfor.me will always be a safe place for those needing and willing to provide prayer.

### Prognosis

I am deliberately keeping this project very lightweight. Economy is found in every aspect of it's design and development.

I'm also cutting my teeth in many aspects on this project — and learning a lot! So things may go slowly...

I welcome constructive feedback to any of the codebase.

**Kind regards, Spike**
